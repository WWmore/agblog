  <ul>
    <li>Gaussian curvature measures the local area distortion under the Gaussian spherical mapping.</li>
    <li>Gaussian curvature is preserved under isometric mappings.</li>
    <li>there is no distortion-free map of the earth.</li>
    <li>an isometric mapping S → S1 also <strong>preserves the intersection angles</strong> between curves. Moreover, it <strong>preserves surface areas</strong>: a domain B in S and its corresponding domain B1 in S1 have the same surface area.</li>
    <li>an angle-preserving mapping (also called <strong>conformal mapping</strong>) need not be an isometric one.</li>
    <li>In fact, there are many angle-preserving maps between any pair of surfaces.  e, there are many area-preserving mappings.</li>
    <li>Frequently used mappings of the earth are either angle preserving or area preserving. However, they cannot have both properties because preservation of both angles and areas implies an isometric mapping.

    <li>Mean curvature H = (k1 + k2)/2, the arithmetic mean of the principal curvatures. Surfaces with vanishing mean curvature are minimal surfaces, which appear (for example) as shapes of soap films through a closed wire.

    <li>Principal curvature lines or related networks of curves are sometimes used for the generation of surface illustrations that aim at results that are similar to drawings made by artists.

    <li>the osculating paraboloid P is a paraboloid of revolution or a plane (k1 = k2 = 0).</li>
    <li>A sphere S (radius R) has only umbilics.</li>
    <li>At an umbilic, we have the same curvature behavior as for a sphere or a plane; in the latter case we also speak of a flat point.</li>
    <li>At an umbilic the network of principal curvature lines has a singularity.

<p>In any case, we have to note that if we want to have smooth mirror images of smooth curves the mirror surface S must be <strong>curvature continuous</strong>. For a B-spline surface, this is achieved by using degree 3 or higher in both parameter directions.</p>
