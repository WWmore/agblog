    <li>There are two general approaches to capturing physical form.</li>
    <li>One is the use of a <strong>tracking arm</strong>, especially suitable for capturing strings of <strong>point data</strong> from selected feature curves. 捕获挑选的特征曲线上的点云</li>
    <li>The other method uses a laser range scanner and results in a large number of more or less <strong>regularly distributed measurement points</strong> from the surface of the given physical model. 从曲面上获取近乎正则分散的点云</li>
    <li>Finally, all of these point clouds have to be merged into a single combined point cloud represented in the same coordinate system. This procedure is called <strong>registration</strong>.

    <li>Digitizer arms. The method is very well suited to capturing particular selected features of a model.

    <li>Optical scanning devices: Near-range scanners, measure objects of a size less than a few meters.</li>
    <li>Medium- and long-range scanners, when the distance between scanner and object exceeds 2 meters.
