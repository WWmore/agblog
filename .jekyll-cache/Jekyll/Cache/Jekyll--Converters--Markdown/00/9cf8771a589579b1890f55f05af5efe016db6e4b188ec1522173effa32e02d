  <ul>
    <li>three main categories (presentation models, papid prototyping models, and digital fabrication and assembly of parts) as they relate to architecture.

  <ul>
    <li>The processes are based on the form of the material being worked on (e.g., flat sheet materials versus volumetric blocks). Another criterion is whether material is added to or subtracted from shape the design.</li>
    <li>A degree of freedom (DOF) is a geometric definition of freedom of movement either along an axis in space or rotation about an axis in space. In three- dimensional space, there are six degrees of freedom: three degrees for movement in the x, y, and z directions and three degrees for rotation about the x, y, and z axes.</li>
    <li>The DOF is not the only criterion determining the power of a fabrication approach. It is a combination of fabrication technique and geometric DOF that enables us to build abstract geometry in physical form.</li>
