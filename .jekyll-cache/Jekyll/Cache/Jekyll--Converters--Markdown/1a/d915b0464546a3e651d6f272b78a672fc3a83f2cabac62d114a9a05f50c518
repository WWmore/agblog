  <p>However, there is some systematic behavior, and the simplest is the following: At any time instant t0, the normals to the trajectories pass through a point p(t0) (or they are parallel).</p>

  <p>Whereas sweeping often does not allow us to precisely prescribe the location of the sources in space, there is a method for doing so. It is called <strong>skinning</strong>, which wraps a surface (skin) over a given network of curves.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>One calls the set of points on c the <strong>zero level set</strong> of f because for all points of c the value of f is 0.</li>
    <li>The representation of a curve as a level set of a function is also known as <strong>implicit representation</strong>.</li>
    <li>We may look at other level sets of f (also denoted as isolines or isocurves of f), which
are the loci of points where f has the same value k. $f(x,y) = k$</li>
    <li>If we define the new function $g(x,y) = f(x,y) â€“ k$ the k-level set of f appears as the zero-level set of g.</li>
    <li>Any implicitly represented curve c: f(x,y) = 0 may be embedded into a family of level sets f(x,y) = k. By variation of k, we obtain a mathematical description of a curve evolution.</li>
