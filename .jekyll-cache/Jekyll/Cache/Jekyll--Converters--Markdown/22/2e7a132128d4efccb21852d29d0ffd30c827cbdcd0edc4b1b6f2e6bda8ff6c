    <li>Developable surfaces S are characterized by the property that they can be mapped isometrically into the plane.</li>
    <li>Developable surface has the same Gaussian curvature as the plane (i.e., it has vanishing Gaussian curvature).</li>
    <li>Any ruling of such a developable ruled surface must be a <strong>torsal ruling</strong> R. This means that the surface S has the same tangent plane at all points of the same ruling R.</li>
    <li>Three basic types: cylinders, cones, and tangent surfaces of space curves.

  <ul>
    <li>cylinders, cones, tangent surfaces of space curves) have the following common properties: They are special ruled surfaces because a tangent plane is always tangent to the surface along an entire ruling and not just in a single point. We call such surfaces <strong>developable ruled surfaces</strong>.</li>
    <li>Moreover, the surfaces have vanishing Gaussian curvature because their spherical Gaussian image is just a curve. Therefore, a developable surface contains <strong>only parabolic surface points</strong> or <strong>flat points</strong>.</li>
    <li>Thus, the offset surface Sd is also a developable surface.</li>
    <li>The offset surfaces of a cone are in general not cones!</li>
    <li>Surfaces of constant slope are developable.
