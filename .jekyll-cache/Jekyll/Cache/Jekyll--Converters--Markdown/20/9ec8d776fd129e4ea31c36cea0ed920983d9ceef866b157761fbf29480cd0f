<p>Aesthetics is greatly enhanced if the mesh can be decomposed into three families of fair polygons (structure lines).</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>six beams meeting in a node means a significantly higher node complexity compared to other types of meshes.</li>
    <li>the per-area cost of triangular glass panels is higher than that of quadrilateral panels.</li>
    <li>one aims at less steel, more glass, and less weight, which also points to non-triangular faces.</li>
    <li>triangle meshes in general torsion-free nodes do not exist.</li>
    <li>triangle meshes do not possess offsets at constant face-face or edge-edge distance.

    <li>Conjugate curve networks. <br />
Pick a curve c in the network and compute in each of its points the tangent to the curve from the other family. Then, these tangents must form a developable ruled surface.<br />
A network of curves resulting by translation is another simple example of a conjugate curve network.<br />
It carries infinitely many conjugate curve networks!

    <li>Offset surfaces revisited. <br />
Note that the normals of F are normals of F d as well<br />
The tangent planes at corresponding points of F and F d are parallel and at constant distance d.</li>
    <li>PQ meshes with exact offsets. <br />
 An offset mesh Md of a PQ mesh M is parallel to M and lies at constant distance d to M.</li>
    <li><strong>Vertex offsets</strong>: The distance of corresponding vertices of M and Md has a constant value d, which does not depend on the vertex.<br />
 Md is a vertex offset of M if and only if the vertices of the Gaussian image mesh S are contained in the unit sphere S*. In this case, M and Md are <strong>circular meshes</strong> (i.e., each face has a circum-circle).</li>
    <li><strong>Edge offsets</strong>: The distance of corresponding parallel edges of M and Md (actually, lines that carry these edges) does not depend on the edge and equals d.<br />
Md is an edge offset of M exactly if the edges of the Gaussian image mesh S are tangent to the unit sphere S*.</li>
    <li><strong>Face offsets</strong>: The distance of corresponding faces of M and Md (actually, the parallel planes of corresponding faces) is independent of the face and equals d.<br />
 Md is a face offset of M if and only if the faces of the Gaussian image mesh S are tangent to the unit sphere S*. In this case, M and Md are <strong>conical meshes</strong>.

 cone condition at a vertex: The sum of opposite edge angles must be equal: $Ï‰_1 + Ï‰_3 = Ï‰_2 +Ï‰_4.$<br />
 This angle balance condition may also be seen as a discrete condition for orthogonality of the two mesh polygons passing through a vertex.<br />
Because conical meshes are orthogonal and conjugate in a discrete sense, conical meshes are a discrete version of the network of principal curvature lines on a smooth surface.
