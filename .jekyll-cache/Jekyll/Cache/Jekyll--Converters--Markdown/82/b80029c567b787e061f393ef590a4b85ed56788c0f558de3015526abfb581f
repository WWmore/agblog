<ul>
  <li>The set that contains all points of set A and all points of set B, but nothing
else, is called the union of A and B.</li>
  <li>The intersection of A and B is defined as the set of all points that belong both
to A and to B.</li>
  <li>The difference of A and B contains only those points of A that do not lie in
B. Analogously, the difference of B and A consists of points of B that are not
contained in A.
