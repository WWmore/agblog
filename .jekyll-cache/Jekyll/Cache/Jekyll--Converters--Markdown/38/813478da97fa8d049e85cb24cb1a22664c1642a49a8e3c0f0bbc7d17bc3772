  <ul>
    <li>There are two general approaches to capturing physical form.</li>
    <li>One is the use of a <strong>tracking arm</strong>, especially suitable for capturing strings of <strong>point data</strong> from selected feature curves. æ•è·æŒ‘é€‰çš„ç‰¹å¾æ›²çº¿ä¸Šçš„ç‚¹äº‘</li>
    <li>The other method uses a laser range scanner and results in a large number of more or less <strong>regularly distributed measurement points</strong> from the surface of the given physical model. ä»æ›²é¢ä¸Šè·å–è¿‘ä¹æ­£åˆ™åˆ†æ•£çš„ç‚¹äº‘</li>
    <li>Finally, all of these point clouds have to be merged into a single combined point cloud represented in the same coordinate system. This procedure is called <strong>registration</strong>.
